  The container on the Redis server and its volume have now both been moved to
  the second host, and Flocker has maintained its link to the web application on
  the first host:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Visit <a href="https://1.2.3.4/">http://1.2.3.4/</a>. You will see the visit
    count is still persisted on this node even though the application is no
    longer running on that host
  </li>
  <li>
    Visit <a href="https://5.6.7.8/">http://5.6.7.8/</a>. You will see that the
    count still persists, even though the container with the volume has moved
    between hosts.
  </li>
</ul>
